Everything you need is here.

Read the comments in the .js file and the .php file to figure out how everything works.

Version 1.0:
  - Automatically pulls images from a directory of your choosing.
  - Scrolls imported images from right to left, then restarts when it gets to 
    the end.
  - Carousel pauses when user scrolls over either the carousel element or the 
    buttons.
  - User can click "previous" and "next" buttons and carousel will change to 
    that image.
	+ If "previous" is clicked carousel will scroll from left to right.
	+ If "next" is clicked carousel will scroll from right to left
  - Carousel automatically calculates how many images there are.
